**SUMMARY**

This project aims to find the most quality movies to watch, i.e. the most awarded by experts.
This is done by looking at an index designed to weigh award categy (big five or other), nomination, and actual award.
As the final result a list of 15 movies will be provided and next steps (for further projects)
The project is written in Python and uses packages like pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib for data analysis and visualization.
